## My Multi-Robot Simulation Environment
* ME740 Intelligent Mechanics Course Project 

This environment will implment three kinds of multi-robot control strategies on two kinds of dynamics.
Control strategy: virtual structure, behavior-based control, leader-follower control. 
Dynamics: differential drive dynamics, omni-directional dynamics.
